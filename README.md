This Project Is Based On ESP32-CAM. It Is Used To Control The Lock Of The Door And Read The "Read Me" Document For More And Better Information!

If You Are Visiting This Page After Seeing My Bot, It Is A Sincere Request That This Bot Will Work Only For My Account.
If You Want One, You Can Create It By The Guidelines That I Have Mentioned In This Repository.


In This Project, I Am Using A Micro Controller Called ESP32-CAM.
I Am Using The Face Recognition Feature Available In This ESP32-CAM.
When The Face Is Recognized Is Verified, It Will Directly Unlock The Solenoid Lock.
If The Face Recognized Is Not Verified, It Will Send A Message In Telegram Through Bot API.
Then, We Can Use To Bot To Interact With The ESP32-CAM To Unlock Or Lock The Door From AnyWhere In The World!
I Am Also Adding Tazer Function Which Can Be Controlled Through Telegram Bot.
We Can Enable Tazer When We Feel The Intruder Is Dangerous.
By This, We Created A Simple Security System For Beginners With A Low Cost (Around $25)!
Finally, This Is Mr. FlareBlitz Signing Off.
Have A Great Day!
